# notes

## Goals: 
- develop strategy for client
- determine how many batches of each type of coffee blend to make based on **user selection**:
    - maximize income
    - minimize leftover Ethiipia beans
    - minimize leftover Hondorus beans
    - minimize leftover Rwanda beans
- Returns:
    - quantities of each type of blend
    - total income
    - lbs of each type of bean left unused

*batches are 100lbs*

### Plan
1. class that contains input >> driver
2. initiate warehouse.py
---contains beans present
---contains max possible revenue method # quick upper bound
            max possible batches method # 
>"We use a recursive search that tries making different amounts of each coffee blend, but we stop exploring a branch as soon as it’s impossible for it to make more money than the best solution we’ve already found. This makes the search much faster while still guaranteeing the best answer."



3. initiate blend.py
